    """
The program solves time-dependent Schroedinger equation for a time-dependent,
nonlinear Hamiltonian, using the semi-global propagator by Hillel Tal-Ezer.
An inhomogeneos source term can be included.
Input:
Gop: A function object of the form Gop(u, t, v, *args), where:
    u: A 1D ndarray which represents the state vector
    t: The time variable (scalar)
    v: A 1D ndarray which represents any vector of the dimension of u
    args: Optional additional arguments
Gop returns G(u, t)v (in quantum mechanics, G(u, t) = -iH(u, t)/hbar). The 
optional arguments included in args will be written in the place of *args in
the current function, separated by commas.
Gdiff_op: A function object of the form Gdiff_op(u1, t1, u2, t2, *args), where:
    u1: 2D ndarray; represents the state vector in several time points, where
    different time-points are resresented by separate columns.
    t1: 1D ndarray; represents the time points in which the corresponding
    columns of u1 are evaluated.
    u2: 1D ndarray; represents the state vector in a particular time-point.
    t1: scalar; represents the time-point in which u2 is evaluated.
    args: As above; the optional arguments must be the same as for Gop.
Gdiff_op returns a 2D ndarray, where the j'th column represents
(G(u1[:, j], t1[j]) - G(u2, t2))u1[:, j],
where t1[j] is the j'th time point and u1[:, j] is the j'th column of u1.
Gdiff_matvecs: The number of matrix-vector multiplications required for
the computation of the operation of Gdiff_op for each time-point (usually less than 2).
(The number of matrix-vector multiplications is counted as the number of large 
scale operations with the highest scaling with the dimension of the problem.)
ui: 1D ndarray; represents the initial state vector.
tgrid: The time grid of the desired output solution (see U in the output).
Should be ordered in an increasing order for a forward propagation, and a 
decreasing order for a backward propagation.
Nts: The number of time steps of the propagation. 
Nt_ts: The number of interior Chebyshev time points in each time-step, used during
the computational process (M in the paper).
Nfm: The number of expansion terms for the computation of the function of 
matrix (K in the paper).
tol: The desired tolerance of the convergence (epsilon in the paper)
ihfun: A function object of the form: ihfun(t, *args), where:
    t: 1D ndarray; represents several time-points.
    args: As above; the optional arguments must be the same as for Gop.
ihfun returns a 2D ndarray which represents the inhomogeneous source term
(s(t) in the paper) in the time points specified by t. Different time-points 
are represented by separate columns. The number of rows of the output of ihfun
is identical to the dimension of the state vector.
The default None value means that there is no inhomogeneous term (s(t) \equiv 0).
ev_domain: ndarray/list/tuple of 2 terms; the (estimated) boundaries of the eigenvalue
domain of G(u, t); required when a Chebyshev algorithm is used for the computation of
the function of matrix.
The default None value means that the Arnoldi algorithm is employed instead.
The general form for an ndarray is np.r_[lambda_min, lambda_max], where
lambda_min is the (estimated) lowest eigenvalue of G(u, t), and lambda_max is
the (estimated) highest eigenvalue.
Since G(u, t) is time-dependent, its eigenvalue domain is also time-dependent.
Hence, ev_domain has to cover all the eigenvalue domains of G(u, t) throughout
the propagation process.
Niter: The maximal allowed number of iterations for all time-steps
excluding the first
Niter1st: The maximal allowed number of iterations for the first time-step
test_tpoint: Represents the test point for the time-expansion error computation;
defined as the difference between the test point and the beginning of the time
step. It is the same for all time steps. The default None value means that the 
default test point is computed by the program.
data_type: The data-type object of the output solution
display_mode: A boolean variable; True (default) means that warnings are displayed
during the propagation. False means that warnings are displayed only
before and after the propagation.
save_memoty: A boolean variable; False (default) means that the solution in all propagation
grid (history['U'] in the output) and test points (history['Utestp']) is stored
in the memory and is contained in the output dictionary of the propagation
details, history. True means the opposite.
args: Optional additional arguments for the input functions: Gop, Gdiff_op,
and ihfun; they should be written in the place of *args separated by commas.

Output:
U: 2D ndarray; contains the solution at the time points specified in tgrid; 
the different time-points are respresented by separate columns.
history: A dictionary with the details of the propagation process; contains the
following keys:
    mniter: The mean number of iteration for a time step, excluding the first step,
    which typically requires more iterations. Usually, mniter should be 1 for ideal
    efficiency of the algorithm.
    matvecs: The number of G(u, t) operations on a vector
    t: 1D ndarray; the time grid of propagation
    U: 2D ndarray; the solution at t, where different time-points are represented
    by separate columns
    Utestp: 2D ndarray; the solution at all test-points in all time-steps,
    where different time steps are represented by separate columns
    texp_error: 1D ndarray; the estimations for the error of U resulting from the 
    time-expansion, for all time-steps
    f_error: 1D ndarray; the estimations for the error of the computation of the
    function of matrix for all time-steps (for the Arnoldi approximation only)
    fUerror: 1D ndarray; the estimations for the error of U, resulting from the
    computation of the function of matrix, for all time-steps
    conv_error: 1D ndarray; the estimations for the convergence errors for all time-steps
    niter: 1D ndarray; the number of iterations for each time-steps 
    max_errors: A nested dictionary which contains the maximal estimated errors;
    contains the following keys:
        texp: The maximal estimated error of U, resulting from the time-expansions in
        each time-step
        fU: The maximal estimated error of U, resulting from the computation of
        the function of matrix
        f: The maximal estimated error of the function of matrix
        computation itself
        conv: The maximal estimated convergence error
