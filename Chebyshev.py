    """
The function computes the vectors: v_k = T_k(operator)u0, where u0 is a vector,
T_k(x) is the k'th degree Chebyshev polynomial, and operator is a linear operator.
These vectors can be used for construction of a Chebyshev expansion of any
function of operator which operates on the vector u0, as follows:
f(operator)u0 \approx \sum_{k=0}^{Ncheb - 1} c_k*v_k,
where the c_k's are the Chebyshev coefficients (see chebc).
The c_k's are f dependent, and can be computed by the program chebc.
The program is useful when it is required to compute several functions
of the same operator, which operate on the same vector.
operator: A function object of the form: operator(v); the function returns 
the operation of the operator on the one-dimensional ndarray v.
u0: A one dimensional ndarray; mathematically defined above
Ncheb: The number of expansion terms/Chebyshev coefficients/output vectors
leftb, rightb: Scalars; define the boundaries of the eigenvalue domain of the
operator, [leftb, rightb].
Output: Two dimensional ndarray which contains the v_k vectors defined above.
Let M be a view of the output ndarray; its columns M[:, k] represent the corresponding v_k's.
